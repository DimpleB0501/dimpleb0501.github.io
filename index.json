You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!

Farmlands are often filled with obstacles such as trees, structures, and poles, which can be dangerous when flying low. To address this challenge, the proposed system combines depth data from RGB-D camera with an IMU to generate LiDAR-like data, ensuring seamless integration with any range sensor-based avoidance algorithms. The entire perception and processing stack runs on the sense-and-avoid module, which can be easily mounted on MAVLink compatible flight controller. This allows the UAV to detect and avoid obstacles in real time, transitioning from semi-autonomous to fully autonomous flight control. By minimizing yaw during navigation, the system ensures both energy efficiency and stability, using only 40 % of the onboard processor, leaving room for the integration of additional functionalities, such as aerial spraying, data collection, etc. The effectiveness of the system was validated through simulations and real-world tests, showing reliable performance in diverse agricultural settings. This vehicle-agnostic sense-and-avoid technology has broad applications in agriculture, surveillance, and disaster relief, improving UAV navigation in obstacle-dense environments.

These systems enable early detection of surface anomalies and plant stress by analyzing reflectance patterns beyond the visible spectrum. I am currently leading a team focused on multispectral data acquisition and AI-based inferencing for two critical projects: Surface Detection of Oil and Water from Underground Pipelines – Utilizing spectral analysis to detect oil leaks and water contamination on the surface, supporting early intervention and environmental protection. AI-Based Farm Advisory System for Onion Cultivation – Applying drone phenotyping to monitor plant health, detect stress conditions like thrips and anthracnose, and provide yield predictions to assist farmers via the iSaarthi mobile platform. These projects aim to solve real-world challenges in infrastructure safety and precision agriculture using drone-enabled multispectral intelligence. Surface Detection of Oil and Water from Underground Pipelines This project, in collaboration with HPCL, IOCL, and GAIL, focuses on detecting surface signatures of oil and water leaks originating from underground pipelines using multispectral imaging and AI-based analysis. Problem Statement: Pilferage Detection A significant challenge faced by oil and gas companies is the undetected pilferage and leakage of oil from underground pipelines. Early surface-level detection can prevent environmental damage, operational downtime, and economic losses. Figure: Multispectral image analysis for oil vs water pipeline Preliminary Spectral Analysis Initial analysis focused on identifying spectral bands that effectively distinguish between oil and water on soil and vegetation. Multispectral imaging helped isolate key wavelengths where oil and water show distinct reflectance patterns. Figure: Spectral band comparison of oil and water Dataset Creation and Model Development A custom multispectral dataset was created under controlled conditions using varying quantities of oil, water, and vegetation. This comprehensive dataset enabled the training of a robust deep learning model based on the YOLOv8 architecture. The model achieved an accuracy of 92.9% for oil detection and 96% for water detection, showcasing strong performance in surface leak classification tasks. Phase 2: Real-World Deployment In the second phase of the project, we plan to augment the current dataset with real-world data collected from actual pipeline leakage sites, in collaboration with industry partners such as IOCL, HPCL, and GAIL. This phase aims to validate and improve the model\u0026#39;s performance under diverse environmental and terrain conditions. Field data will include site-specific spectral signatures, soil types, and contamination patterns to ensure the model generalizes well to operational settings. In parallel, comparative benchmarking against other state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms is ongoing, and the results will contribute to a scientific publication currently under development. AI-Based Farm Advisory System for Onion Cultivation In collaboration with ICAR-DOGR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research - Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research), this project focuses on developing an AI-powered farm advisory system tailored for onion farming. Leveraging multispectral imaging and advanced machine learning models, the system aims to detect various forms of plant stress including thrips infestation, anthracnose disease, and water drought conditions. It also incorporates yield prediction models for improved crop management. The ultimate goal is to integrate drone-based phenotyping with the iSaarthi mobile application, which aggregates data from ground control stations, onboard agro-sensors, and mobile imagery captured by farmers. This fusion of aerial and ground-level data supports real-time, location-specific advisories to empower farmers with actionable insights.
